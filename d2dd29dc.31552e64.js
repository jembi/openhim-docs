This ensures that the message is transformed into a form that the HIM can process, thus enabling syntactic interoperability for the transaction. For example, if the transaction arrives from a legacy application that only supported exporting data in a custom XML format, this process would ensure that the XML is transformed into the canonical form that the HIM can understand, such as an HL7 version 2 messages. Secondly, a translation operation is invoked. This operation is responsible for ensuring that the codes and code systems used within the transaction are translated to a standard set of vocabulary or clinical terms, called reference terms, that have a common interpretation by other components of the HIM.
