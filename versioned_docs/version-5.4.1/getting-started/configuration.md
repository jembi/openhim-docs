Once you have successfully installed the OpenHIM core and console and you are able to successfully access the console at <http://localhost:9000> we can proceed to create a basic channel and client so that we can send a test request through the OpenHIM core.

A **Client** is usually some system that you want to be able to send request to the OpenHIM. Setting up a **client** allows the OpenHIM to authenticate requests. A **Channel** defines a path that a request will take through the OpenHIM. It describes one more **routes** for the request to be forwarded to, which **clients** are allowed to use this **channel**, which requests are to be directed to this **channel** and many more options that allow you to control what happens for a particular request.

To manage **clients** and **channels** you will need to log into the OpenHIM console and then you may follow the steps below.

> **Note** - Only an Admin user has the permission to Add/Edit/Delete a **Client** or **Channel**

## Adding Clients

Follow the below steps to successfully create/update a **Client**

- Navigate to the **Clients** page on the OpenHIM Console.
- Here you will be presented with a list of all the created **Clients**
- Click on the blue **+ Client** button to open a popup modal box where you will supply the **Client** details **OR** click on one of the existing **Clients** to open up the popup modal with the **Client**'s saved details.
- Supply all the required fields (marked with a \*) and click the blue **Save changes** button when completed.

There are many fields available, to find a detailed explanation of all possible fields, please refer to the [Clients documentation](../configuration/clients) page

## Adding Channels

Follow the below steps to successfully create/update a **Channel**

- Navigate to the **Channels** menu option found in the left sidebar.
- On the **Channels** page you will be presented with a list of all the created **Channels**
- Click on the blue "**+ Channel**" button to open a popup modal box where you will supply the **Channel** details **OR** click on one of the existing **Channels** to open up the popup modal with the **Channels'** saved details.
- Supply all the required fields and click the blue "**Save changes**" button when completed.

The two _most_ important fields to supply are the **URL Pattern** field and the **Allowed roles and clients** field. The **URL Pattern** field describes which incoming requests should be sent down this **channel**. It does this by looking at the URL of the incoming request and testing if it matches the RegEx that you supply in this field.

> **Note**, *only the first* url matched **channel** that is found receives the request for processing.

The **Allowed roles and clients** field identifies which **clients** are allowed to send requests to this **channel**. If a request matches a private **channel** but the **client** system is not specified in this field or a **role** which contains the **client** is not specified in this field then the request will be denied access to the **channel** as it could not successfully authenticate the the supplied authentication details to those linked to the channel.

There are many fields that you may supply, to find a detailed explanation of all the available fields, please refer to the [Channels documentation](../configuration/channels) page

## Example

For this example, we will be creating a very basic channel that requires client authentication details to verify the request is authorized for the specific channel being requested.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="manual"
  values={[
    { label: 'Manual', value: 'manual', },
    { label: 'Import Config', value: 'import', }
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="manual">

Lets proceed by supplying the below details within our relevant sections to complete this configuration of our channel and client.

**Client:**

- clientID: `HL7`
- client Name: `Health Level 7`
- Add new Role: `HL7`
- Basic Auth Password: `hl7password`

**Channel:**

- Basic Info Tab:
  - name: `HL7 Patient example Channel`
- Request Matching Tab:
  - urlPatten: `/hl7-patient-example`
  - Channel Authentication: `Private`
  - Client to access this channel: `HL7`
- Routes Tab: Add new route:
  - Name: `HL7 patient example Route`
  - Route Secured: `yes`
  - Host: `www.hl7.org`
  - Port: `443`
  - Route Path: `/fhir/patient-example.json`

Once you have configured your client and channel **as described in the above example**, you should now be able to successfully make a authenticated request through the OpenHIM to fetch the example HL7 FHIR Patient object.

Execute the below command in your terminal to see the output of the request.

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5001/hl7-patient-example" -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n HL7:hl7password | base64)"
```

You can also use any alternative 3rd party client to send this request through the OpenHIM. An example of a 3rd party client is [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
