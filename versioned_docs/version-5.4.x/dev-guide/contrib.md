If you would like to contribute to either of the OpenHIM projects ([openhim-core](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-core-js) or [openhim-console](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-console)) then feel free to fork either repository and send us a pull request. The maintainers will strive to review the code and merge it in if all is well.

If you don't want to submit code but you notice an issue with either project, please report it on the relevant github issues page:

- [Submit a core issue](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-core-js/issues/new)
- [Submit a console issue](https://github.com/jembi/openhim-console/issues/new)

Thanks for contributing! :)
