A client is usually a system that you want to be able to send request to the OpenHIM. Setting up a client allows the OpenHIM to authenticate requests.

Using an OpenHIM administrative account, you will be able to add, edit and remove clients by following the steps below.

The following is an explanation of the fields that are used in the `Add Client` form:

- **Client ID** - This is a unique ID which a client will use as a reference when adding channels as well as for authorisation checking.
- **Client Name** - This is a descriptive name of the client.
- **Domain** - A domain that is associated with a client.
  > **Note**: The domain needs to match the CN of the certificate if a certificate is used otherwise the client won’t be authorised successfully.
- **Roles** - The client roles field is a list of authorized user groups that are allowed to access this channel. You can either select a role from the existing roles, or you can add a new role to the list by typing in the role and pressing Enter.
- **JSON Web Token** - JWTs are small encoded packages of data that can be used to authenticate a client.
- **Custom Token** - The Custom Token is a unique string value associated with a specific Client.
- **Mutual TLS** - The client certificate and domain fields are used when the OpenHIM core is running using mutual TLS authentication and needs to authenticate requests coming from the client. By default, the OpenHIM core uses mutual TLS authentication.
- **Basic Auth** - The password field is used when the OpenHIM core is running in basic auth mode and does not require a certificate, however, it does require a password.

## How to add clients

> **Note**: All fields marked with a \* or \*\* indicates a mandatory field.

    * - Indicates a required field which means that it cannot be left blank.
    ** - Indicates that one of the fields are required.

1. Log in to your OpenHIM console.
1. Click on `Clients` found in the left navigation menu.
1. Click on the button labelled `+ Client` to open a popup window where you will be able to supply the client details.
1. Capture the client details.
1. Assign an existing role or enter a name for a new role which will be created and linked to this client.
1. You may choose to make use of JWT, Custom Tokens, Basic Auth, or Mutual TLS depending on your OpenHIM configuration. At least one Auth mechanism is required. See the [authentication](./authentication) section for more details
1. Click on the `Save Changes` button to save your new client.

> **Note**: When a client certificate is added or updated in the certificates component of the OpenHIM, the OpenHIM console will inform the OpenHIM administrator that a server restart is required. This is for the new certificate to be applied correctly. The user can either decide to manually restart the server at a later time or to click the red `Restart Server Now!` button.

## Client Roles

The purpose of these roles is to act as a list of authorised user groups which are allowed to access and use a given channel. These roles are generally assigned during the creation process when adding a new client.

The following rules apply to roles:

- A role may be assigned to one or more clients.
- When a role is deleted, all clients referencing this role will be automatically updated by unlinking the role.
- A client may be associated with one or more roles.

### How to use roles

`Roles` allow the OpenHIM administrator to quickly and effortlessly enable or disable channels to which a role has access. The purpose and use of channels will be covered a little later in this document.
