The following steps will guide you through the process of installing the OpenHIM using docker images.

1. Install **Docker** via terminal `curl https://get.docker.com/ | sh -` Or install Docker using the link below, follow all the steps and most importantly, ensure that there is no previous docker installed while following [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).
1. Install **Docker Compose**, follow all the steps [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) and use the recommend example version which is the latest stable release.
1. Install Git `sudo apt install git`
1. Clone the repository for setting up a docker image `git clone https://github.com/jembi/openhim-common.git`
1. Navigate into the repo `cd openhim-common`
1. Build the docker images `docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d`
1. Access the OpenHIM Console on <http://localhost:9000>
