Data for Accountability Transparency and Impact (DATIM)

Data for Accountability, Transparency and Impact Monitoring (DATIM), a project of the U.S. Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), was created to help save the lives of those suffering from HIV/AIDS worldwide by collecting AIDS data to analyze PEPFAR program effectiveness and efficiency and help improve overall accountability.

DATIM is the PEPFAR-specific version of DHIS2 and is used to collect data at all necessary levels of granularity for:

* Facility and community-based site level reporting
* Sub-national and national aggregations

Since the implementation of DATIM in 2015, over 10,000 people in 58 countries have used the DATIM DHIS2 platform (Measure evaluation, 2016).

## How the OpenHIM is used

The OpenHIM enables the transmission of aggregate data between DATIM Node, the data collected at country-level, and DATIM Global, where the data is analysed and evaluated. Aggregate data is sent using an ADX transaction with appropriate metadata.
